Project to train different gpt-like models using context free grammars. This is based on work from the paper [Physics of Language Models: Part 1, Learning Hierarchical Language Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13673)

To use this project you'll first need to install the project to generate CFGs found here: https://github.com/PolarState/CFG. Clone this repo and install the package locally (preferably in a virtual environment) via:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PolarState/CFG.git
cd CFG
python -m pip install -e .
